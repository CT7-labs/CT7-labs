# I'm working on Project Sonder

Project Sonder is my long term mission of building a fully custom computer, from as low level as is reasonable to go.

Here's a concise list of the things I'm working on:

- Chip architecture
- Instruction set (RISC-like)
- I/O capabilities
- Memory layout
- Video capabilities
- PCB layout
- Kernal
- Software
- Assembly language
- Programming language
- Emulator
- Case (As much as I like open PCBs, a case would be sweet)
- Probably more

This project is involving multiple disciplines that I'll be fairly proficient in by the end of it.

Here's a concise list of the disciplines involved:

- FPGA design (with Verilog)
- Digial logic design
- Computer architecture (lots of it)
- PCB design
- Assembly programing
- Kernal / OS development

I estimate I'll have finished the first prototype, *Argon*, around the start of October 2024.
